This Python script defines a function generate_password that creates a random password of a specified length, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation. The default length is set to 10 characters, but you can customize it by providing a different length as an argument.

The generate_password function uses the random and string modules to create a password by randomly selecting characters from the combined set of ASCII letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and punctuation.

After defining the function, the script generates a password using the default length and prints it to the console.
